    // - Let M be a contract and A be any address (not the Bank).
    // - M first calls deposit with value V ≥ 2 wei, so credits[M] increases by V−1.
    // - M then calls withdraw(V−1). Bank executes msg.sender.call{value: V−1} to M.
    // - In M’s receive/fallback, M immediately forwards the received ETH to A.
    // - After this single withdraw transaction, A’s ETH balance increased, but A was not the sender of the transaction.
